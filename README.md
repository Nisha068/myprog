## palen.c :

A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward or forward.

Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored.

For example, isPalindrome("Deleveled") should return true as character case should be ignored, resulting in "deleveled", which is a palindrome since it reads the same backward and forward.

Examples:

Deleveled (isPalindrome function should return true)
Puzzled (isPalindrome function should return false)


## anagram.c :

Write a program that checks whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are anagram of each other.

Examples:

Given “listen” and “silent” the program should print - True
Given “triangle” and “integer” the program should print - False


## freq.c : 

Given a paragraph that contains sentences, you should write a program that takes the paragraph as input and print top 5 words with highest number of occurrences. You should ignore the case-sensitivity of the words. 

A word contains only english alphabet characters. 

Output should display the words with highest frequency of occurrences. If the count is same, then they should be sorted in alphabetical order.

Example: 
Input String: 
“You develop Classes, create Objects out of those classes, and use them with other classes and objects”

Output: 
classes - 3
and - 2
objects - 2
create - 1
develop - 1
